First we'll do standardize the features such that each feature has a mean of 0 and unit variance.

    "**Therefore, when considering both person-specific and non-person-specific features, the most important features for predicting thermal preference are Age, Clo, Met, Subject height, Subject weight, Sex, Outdoor monthly air temperature, Climate, City, Season, and Koppen climate classification. The average recall using these most important features in a kNN model is ~0.58. Whether we use only these most important features or all of the features, we get almost the same average recall.** Since we get the same average recall either way, this means that the excluded features do not improve the model's predictive performance very much and don't need to be included. Future thermal comfort studies that will be added to the ASHRAE database can be designed in such a way so that these excluded features are not measured.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook was to answer \"How do human and personal factors influence thermal comfort perception?\" using metadata from thermal comfort studies. When considering only person-specific features to predict thermal preference, the most important features to predict thermal preference are Clo, Met, Subject height, and Subject weight. **This suggests that these personal factors are the ones that most strongly influence thermal comfort perception.** However, these person-specific features are not the best to use to predict thermal preference. Instead, the non-person-specific features of Outdoor monthly air temperature, Climate, City, Koppen climate classification, Season, Air temperature, and Year yield the best average recall (~0.59) in a kNN model used to predict thermal preference. A kNN model that used these non-person-specific features performed better than a kNN model that used both person-specific and non-person-specific features, suggesting that environmental factors rather than personal factors most strongly influence thermal comfort perception.\n"
